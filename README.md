# TurboGuido - Car Rental Replica – Built with Next.js, React, TypeScript & RapidAPI

This project is a **full-stack car rental platform replica** built using modern web technologies — **Next.js**, **React**, and **TypeScript** — designed to deliver a real-time, visually responsive experience. It fetches live vehicle data using **RapidAPI** and dynamically renders car visuals via **Imagin Studio**.

From intelligent price calculations to smooth UI transitions, this project is a performance-first approach to building interactive web apps with modular design and third-party integrations.

## ✨ Project Highlights

### ⚛️ Component-Based UI with React

- The entire application is structured using a **modular component architecture**.
- Components like `CarCard`, `Filter`, `Hero`, and `SearchBar` encapsulate logic and styles.
- Promotes **reusability**, **readability**, and fast updates across the UI.

> You can add new components or extend existing ones with minimal code duplication.

---

### 🔄 Dynamic Data Fetching with Next.js

- Utilizes **Next.js API routes** for backend logic and external API proxying.
- Fetches car data from **RapidAPI** based on user-selected filters (make, model, fuel type, etc.).
- Asynchronous fetching ensures a **non-blocking UI**, maintaining performance even during heavy API interactions.

> Real-time filtering means users get immediate feedback while exploring cars.

---

### 💰 Real-Time Rental Price Calculation

- Each car’s rental price is calculated dynamically based on:
  - Mileage
  - Age of the vehicle
- Price logic is handled **locally and reactively**, so values update without re-rendering the entire DOM.

> Users get instant feedback, making the experience feel smooth and intelligent.

---

### 🖼️ Visual Rendering with Imagin Studio

- Car thumbnails are rendered using **Imagin Studio’s API**, which generates high-resolution images dynamically based on car specs.
- This ensures lightweight loading and consistent visuals across different car models.

> No manual asset management — just clean, scalable image delivery.

---

### 📱 Responsive Design & UX

- Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop with **flexible layouts and media queries**.
- **Framer Motion (optional)** or smooth CSS transitions improve navigation fluidity.
- Image optimization and lazy loading enhance performance on slower networks.

> The UI adapts gracefully no matter the screen size or device.

---

### 🧠 Error Handling & Stability

- Built-in **error boundaries** and **try/catch blocks** ensure smooth fallback for failed API requests.
- Graceful UI fallbacks are shown when external data fails to load (e.g., no image, no car results).

> Reliability and user trust go hand in hand — so nothing breaks the flow.
